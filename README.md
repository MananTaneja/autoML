## Introduction

In Machine Learning, deciding appropriate preprocessing algorithms and machine learning algorithms for a given problem is not a well defined area. A technically non-savvy practitioner often finds it difficulty to choose between a dizzying choice of algorithms. Even a technical practitioner finds it difficulty to make the right choice. So automated machine learning is an emerging area. This is concerned with automating the choice of algorithms tailored to the given problem. Evolutionary Algorithms are well suited for this task. This is one direction I would like to explore.
